The website links to the last edition.  

If You want to create a new edition of the conference:

* (1) create a new directory and name it with the year of the last edition, e.g. 2022;
* (2) COPY and PASTE all the files and directories except the directories named with year values (e.g. 2018, 2019, 2021, etc) in the new directory;
* (3) Now you can edit the files in the root directory for the new edition of the conference.
