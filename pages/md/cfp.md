# Research and Innovation Track
The Research and Innovation track at SEMANTiCS 2023 EU welcomes papers on novel scientific research and/or innovations relevant to the topics of the conference. Submissions must be original and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must follow the guidelines given in the author instructions, including references and optional appendices. Each submission will be reviewed by several PC members who will judge

## Topics of Interest
SEMANTiCS 2023 especially invites contributions that target the use of semantic-based research and systems in the context of applicative domains, including Cultural Heritage, Legal environments, Scholarly Communication, Medical and other Health-related contexts, Environment, etc.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Web Semantics & Linked (Open) Data
* Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, Graph Data Management
* Machine Learning Techniques for/using Knowledge Graphs (e.g. reinforcement learning, deep learning, data mining and knowledge discovery)
* Knowledge acquisition, capture, extraction, authoring, management, integration, publication
* Terminology, Thesaurus & Ontology Management
* Reasoning, Rules, and Policies
* Natural Language Processing for/using Knowledge Graphs (e.g. entity linking and resolution using target Knowledge such as Wikidata and DBpedia, foundation models)
* Crowdsourcing  for/using Knowledge Graphs
* Data Quality Management and Assurance
* Mathematical Foundation of Knowledge-aware AI
* Multimodal Knowledge Graphs
* Semantics in Data Science
* Semantics in Blockchain environments
* Trust, Data Privacy, and Security with Semantic Technologies
* Economics of Data, Data Services, and Data Ecosystems
* IoT and Stream Processing
* Conversational AI and Dialogue Systems
* Provenance and Data Change Tracking
* Semantic Interoperability (via mapping, crosswalks, standards, etc.)  


Special Sub-Topics of SEMANTiCS 2023:
* Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage
* LegalTech, AI Safety , Explainable and interoperable AI
* Distributed and Decentralized Knowledge Graphs


Application of Semantically Enriched and AI-Based Approaches:
* Knowledge Graphs in Bioinformatics and Medical AI
* Clinical Use Case of AI-based Approaches
* AI for Environmental Challenges  
* Semantics in Scholarly Communication and Open Research Knowledge Graphs
* AI and LOD within GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) institutions

## Author Guidelines and Submission

* The Research and Innovation Track welcomes long and short papers. Long papers should have 12-15 pages of content (excluding references) and short papers of a maximum length of 6 pages of content (excluding references). Since they are excluded from page counting, it is fine to have one or more additional pages for references if they are relevant to the study submitted.  
* Submissions should follow the guidelines of IOS Press. Details are available at https://www.iospress.com/book-article-instructions.
* Abstract submission for all papers is a strict requirement. To facilitate bidding, we strongly suggest the authors to submit as structured abstract as described at XXX.
* All papers and abstracts have to be submitted electronically via Easychair: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sem22#.  
* Submissions must be in English.
* Submissions must be anonymous; the reviewing process is double-blind, but reviewers can disclose their identities by signing their reviews.
* Accepted papers will be published in open access proceedings by IOS Press, and the text of all the reviews (excluding final recommendations) of all the accepted papers will be posted on the conference website and will be archived on Zenodo as public available material.
* At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper.
* To facilitate reproducibility and give peer-reviewers a characterization of a submission by juxtaposing it with related approaches, we encourage you to accompany your paper submission with an ORKG comparison in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (https://orkg.org). More information on the background and how to create an ORKG comparison can be found here: https://www.orkg.org/orkg/help-center/article/38/Accompany_your_paper_submission_with_an_ORKG_comparison).
* In the submission process, you will have the opportunity to submit the link to your comparison to the peer-reviewers.
* The Research and Innovation Track will not accept papers that, at the time of submission, are under review or have already been published in or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference.

## Review and Evaluation Criteria
Each submission will be reviewed by several PC members. The reviewing process is double-blind. However, reviewers can disclose their identity by signing their reviews and adding an persistent identifier representing them if available (e.g. their ORCID).

The text of all the reviews (excluding final recommendations) of all the accepted papers will be posted on the conference website with the basic bibliographic metadata of the reviewed submission (i.e. title and authors) and it will be archived on Zenodo as public available material. All the reviews will be licensed using a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY, the copyright holder will be the reviewer), except the anonymous ones that will be released in CC0.

To enable a fair and appropriate publication of the review text, we ask the reviewers to make sure that the text of the review the does not reveal any confidential information, such as mentions of the conference (i.e. SEMANTiCS 2023) at which the submission is under review and the final recommendation for acceptance/rejection (that should be specified in specific fields, not in the review text).

Papers submitted to this track will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
* Appropriateness
* Originality, novelty, and innovativeness
* Impact of results
* Soundness of the evaluation
* Proper comparison to related work
* Clarity and quality of writing
* Reproducibility of results and resources


A particular emphasis must be given to check the availability of all relevant materials that is necessary to reproduce the outcomes described in the submission. Additional guidelines reviewers must follow in preparing their reviews are available at XXX.
